# 100 Days Of Code - Log

###Days 2-7: January 15th-20th, 2020
#### _Grab Bag_

**Today's Progress** I made it through 10 lessons in freecodecamp today. I'm now 70% done with the CSS curriculum. I've started thinking about my portfolio site and I'm stoked to learn more and eventually create a sort of "capstone" project to put all that I've learned to use.

**Thoughts** I was originally going to admit defeat already, since I didn't do enough logging over the past couple of days. But I have to learn to give myself more credit. What _is_ important is that I _did_ write code each day, even if it was outside of the freecodecamp curriculum I've been emphasizing. Here are some of the things I studied over the past few days:

* Emacs commands in bash
* Using intruder/payloads in Burp Suite to automate attempted attacks
* More vim practice
* Which styles will take precedence when simultaneously using CSS, id attributes, inline formatting and the !important tag 

The lesson about precedence is another example of something that I never learned when teaching myself to code outside of a structured curriculum. I just styled text and hoped for the best. Trial and error were my ways of knowing which takes precedence. I'm happy that I finally know so many ways to style attributes using HTML/CSS, and I'm really thankful for freecodecamp.org!

### Day 1: January 14th, 2020
#### _Steady_

**Today's Progress:** Today I spoke on the phone with a developer that I used to work with for about an hour. I told him my goals, what I want to learn,what kind of projects I want to build once I'm proficient enough. Over the past 9 days I've written bash scripts at work to help me query information I needed. Tonight after my phone call I completed 2 more CSS exercises. I'm now 50% complete with the CSS portion of the freecodecamp curriculum. I learned how to use clockwise notation to adjust all four sides of an object (top, right, bottom, left). I also learned how to copy and paste in vim using V,y,p. :)

**Thoughts** I did not know that you could use clockwise notation to adjust all four sides of an object in a single line. As painful as it is to start this journey at the beginning (I studied HTML/CSS in the myspace.com era...yeah...I'm that old), I'm glad that I'm doing it this way. I'm picking up bits and pieces of stuff that I missed along the way. It's the slow and steady way but I'm hoping it's the way that wins the race.

### Day 0: January 5th, 2020
#### _Starting Over_

**Today's Progress:** Over the past 5 days, I completed the following challenges on freecodecamp.org, as part of the Basic CSS unit of the Responsive Web Design certification.

* Adjust the Padding of an Element
* Use an id Attribute to Style an Element
* Set the id of an Element	
* Give a Background Color to a div Element

**Thoughts:** Starting a new job, a death in the family, my PC completely dying on me, continual struggles in my personal life, learning vim (which I'm using to write this update, btw)...I could make all sorts of excuses on why I abandoned 100 days of code in 2019, but they'd be just that, excuses. Instead I'm just going to get right back on the horse and jump back into this. My new priority will be completing as much of freecodecamp.org as I can. I'll also continue working on python apps to serve my personal and work needs whenever such needs arise. I'd like to continue working on challenges on code wars when opportunities present themselves.

### Day 0: December 31, 2018
#### _Getting Ready_

**Today's Progress:** Forked the original github repo for 100 days of code. I decided that for this, my first "round" of #100daysofcode I'm going to focus on C#/.NET development. I plan on completing some C# coursework and also doing codewars.com exercises in order to actually build things using what I've learned.

**Thoughts:** I'm nervous, but I know I'm going to have a blast once I get started. I've always enjoyed coding, and my career aspirations of becoming a security engineer require me to get more proficient at it.

### Day 1: January 1, 2019
#### _Arabic to Roman and Github Woes_

**Today's Progress:** As a way to get back into serious coding after some months off, I revisited codewars and decided to take on the "Roman Numerals Encoder" Challenge, requires an app to take an integer greater than zero and convert it to a roman numeral. I knocked it out, and posting the code into codewars and watching all of the unit tests pass was SO SATISFYING. I even leveled up! I'm stoked to be back to writing code.

Having successfully created a new app, I decided to upload the project to github. The fact that I'm a serious InfoSec professional who uses multi-factor authentication caused me some problems tonight. I had to do a deep dive and learn how to use MFA in github with SSH keys and user tokens. It took me longer to troubleshoot this than it did to write my app! But alas, at about 12:30am I finally got things figured out and now my code is available in github. Perhaps I'll revisit it later and refactor it with some switch cases and some try/catch blocks.

**Thoughts:** It's interesting that the github troubleshooting took longer to deal with than writing the app itself. I suppose that's the nature of the beast though. Years of InfoSec experience has taught me to remain calm when fires need to be put out. Special thanks to my buddy Samuel Kelemen for helping me troubleshoot the github issues. I linked to his github below and you should check it out.

### Day 2: January 2, 2019
#### _Started Gray Hat C#_

**Today's Progress:** Having spent a good amount of my day at work writing and running powershell scripts, I decided to crack into the _Gray Hat C#_ book that I recently purchased as part of Humble Bundle's holiday hacking bundle. I read the table of contents and the first chapter, which is primarily a crash course intro to C# and mostly covered concepts I already know. 

**Thoughts:** Since I didn't write a whole lot of code today, there's temptation to feel like the day was wasted. I'm fighting that feeling. I learned some new concepts, I learned about the existence of some IDEs, and I learned about a linux answer to C# called "Mono". The importan thing is that _I LEARNED_ today. This book covers some really cool projects and teaches ways to automate some security testing, which I know I will need to do in my career. I'm stoked to read more of it.

### Day 3: January 3, 2019
#### _Improving The Basics_

**Today's Progress:** I completed module 5: _Accessing and using classes_ in the Pluralsight course _C# Best Practices: Improving on the Basics_, taught by Deborah Kurata.

**Thoughts:** This was challenging. I need to get back to **writing** code tomorrow and hopefully find some way to practice the many concepts that were covered in this module. Topics like initialization, instantiating, null checking, and the various ways to assign fields in classes, and the use cases for each.

### Days 4, 5, and 6: January 4-6, 2019

**Progress:** After giving it some thought, I finally came up with a good app to put the OOP skills I'm learning on pluralsight into practice. I created a github repo for an app to generate a character for 5th edition D&D and started coding it. 

**Thoughts:** Rough couple of days emotionally, normally I'd have made more progress than this but at least I took some time each day to actually code.**

### Days 7, 8, and 9: January 7-9, 2019

**Progress:** I added the properties for ability scores to the Hero class of FyVee. I also set up my work PC so that I'm able to make changes from there. Sometimes I prefer the well lit standing desk I have at work. Sometimes (it's rare) I prefer to code _without_ a cat on my lap.

**Thoughts:** The propfull snippit in visual studio is awesome. I've gotten the hang of adding properties to a class using this shortcut. The hero class now has ability scores (strength, constitution, wisdom, intelligence, dexterity, charisma) as well as languages, which will be selected from a list. I got a decent amount of practice with OOP and the basics over the last few days, which is rad.

### Days 10-20, January 10-20, 2019

**Progress:** Added a list for languages in the FyVee App.

**Thoughts:** Got some news from my family about my grandfather's health that hit me hard. I'm also down to just 2 people on my team at work. This time last year we had 7. I thought about just abandoning this project and returning to 100 days of code later in the year, but that's not what my grandfather would want me to do, and it's not healthy or productive to completely start over when you get derailed or knocked off of your horse. Life isn't Tetris on NES. I'm just going to keep at it even though I've already failed the goal of 1hr of code per day. Life happens.
