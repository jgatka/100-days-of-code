# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 31, 2019
#### _Getting Ready_

**Today's Progress:** Forked the original github repo for 100 days of code. I decided that for this, my first "round" of #100daysofcode I'm going to focus on C#/.NET development. I plan on completing some C# coursework and also doing codewars.com exercises in order to actually build things using what I've learned.

**Thoughts:** I'm nervous, but I know I'm going to have a blast once I get started. I've always enjoyed coding, and my career aspirations of becoming a security engineer require me to get more proficient at it.

### Day 1: January 1, 2019
#### _Arabic to Roman and Github Woes_

**Today's Progress:** As a way to get back into serious coding after some months off, I revisited codewars and decided to take on the "Roman Numerals Encoder" Challenge, requires an app to take an integer greater than zero and convert it to a roman numeral. I knocked it out, and posting the code into codewars and watching all of the unit tests pass was SO SATISFYING. I even leveled up! I'm stoked to be back to writing code.

Having successfully created a new app, I decided to upload the project to github. The fact that I'm a serious InfoSec professional who uses multi-factor authentication caused me some problems tonight. I had to do a deep dive and learn how to use MFA in github with SSH keys and user tokens. It took me longer to troubleshoot this than it did to write my app! But alas, at about 12:30am I finally got things figured out and now my code is available in github. Perhaps I'll revisit it later and refactor it with some switch cases and some try/catch blocks.

**Thoughts:** It's interesting that the github troubleshooting took longer to deal with than writing the app itself. I suppose that's the nature of the beast though. Years of InfoSec experience has taught me to remain calm when fires need to be put out. Special thanks to my buddy Samuel Kelemen for helping me troubleshoot the github issues. I linked to his github below and you should check it out.

### Day 2: January 2, 2019
#### _Started Gray Hat C#_

**Today's Progress:** Having spent a good amount of my day at work writing and running powershell scripts, I decided to crack into the _Gray Hat C#_ book that I recently purchased as part of Humble Bundle's holiday hacking bundle. I read the table of contents and the first chapter, which is primarily a crash course intro to C# and mostly covered concepts I already know. 

**Thoughts:** Since I didn't write a whole lot of code today, there's temptation to feel like the day was wasted. I'm fighting that feeling. I learned some new concepts, I learned about the existence of some IDEs, and I learned about a linux answer to C# called "Mono". The importan thing is that _I LEARNED_ today. This book covers some really cool projects and teaches ways to automate some security testing, which I know I will need to do in my career. I'm stoked to read more of it.

### Day 3: January 3, 2019
#### _Improving The Basics_

**Today's Progress:** I completed module 5: _Accessing and using classes_ in the Pluralsight course _C# Best Practices: Improving on the Basics_, taught by Deborah Kurata.

**Thoughts:** This was challenging. I need to get back to **writing** code tomorrow and hopefully find some way to practice the many concepts that were covered in this module. Topics like initialization, instantiating, null checking, and the various ways to assign fields in classes, and the use cases for each.

### Days 4, 5, and 6: January 4-6, 2019

**Today's Progress:** After giving it some thought, I finally came up with a good app to put the OOP skills I'm learning on pluralsight into practice. I created a github repo for an app to generate a character for 5th edition D&D and started coding it. 

**Thoughts:** Rough couple of days emotionally, normally I'd have made more progress than this but at least I took some time each day to actually code.**
